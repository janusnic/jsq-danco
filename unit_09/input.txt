These two examples explain the concept of blocking and non-blocking calls. First example shows that program blocks until it reads the file and then only it proceeds to end the program where as in second example, program does not wait for file reading but it just proceeded to print "Program Ended" and same time program without blocking continues reading the file.

Thus, a blocking program executes very much in sequence and from programming point of view its easier to implement the logic but non-blocking programs does not execute in sequence, so in case a program needs to use any data to be processed, it should be kept with-in the same block to make it sequential execution.
